the z shell

Zsh is a shell designed for interactive use. I use it as my login shell instead
of something like Bash due to how powerful it is, and the fact I spend most of
my time in terminal emulators.

The Zsh configuration found here will have a few niceties you could reuse on
your own setup. They include:

- Git repository detection & hints in the $PROMPT
- ZLE widgets using fzf for Git
- Fuzzy, smart case tab completion

While the aliases and environment variables I use are particular for my setup,
they can serve as example or reminders that some functionalities exist.

d3adb5's dotfiles

These are my dotfiles, I guess. They're here so that I can version them, keep a
backup of them, properly organize them in branches and whatnot. Feel free to
take inspiration from anything here you might like.

The old repository won't be updated anymore. It's old, clunky, the commits are
all over the place and I'd rather start anew than try to fix the mess that I
made for myself.
